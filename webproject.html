		Decent Work, according to the International Labour Organization, "sums up the aspirations of people in their working lives." It is humane work where people want a wage that they can live on, security from hazards and job loss, freedom to make suggestions and bring up concerns without the fear of a pay cut or being terminated and gender and racial equality in the workplace. Economic growth is when there is an increase of goods and services compared to the population of a certain area, according to Oxford Languages.

		In order to achieve this SDG in before 2030, we must first eradicate forced and child labor. According to the <a href = "https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm"> International Labour Organization</a>, 27.6 million people were in forced labor with 17.3 million in the private sector, 6.3 million in prostitution and 3.9 million forced to work by their respective governments. Poverty is one of the main reasons why people choose ot participate in forced labors. Parents sell their children in order to make ends meet in developing countries. People put their lives at risk many times just to make a living when they have no other choice. In order to stop this, we must implement legislation that targets those who run illegal operations that put their workers at risk.

		Governments, according to the <a href = "https://www.ituc-csi.org/IMG/pdf/TU_Guide_Forced_labour_EN.pdf">International Trade Union Confederation</a>, can also produce economic growth by investing in education for entrepreneurship which will create new opprtunities for business creation and development and in education for vocational training providing workers with necessary skills for the job market. Governments should also be able enforce regulations and standards in order to promote good business practices that protect the worker, consumer, and the environment.

	<h2> <mark class = "heading"> What Can You Do To Help </mark> </h2>
	<p class = "first">
		Here are somethings that you can do in order to help promote SDG 8:
		<ul>
			<li class = "first">Buy fair trade products: These products have been certified to come from companies and cooperatives to treat their workers well and make sustainable products.</li>
			<li class = "second"> Use products responsibly: Try to reduce your use of commodities that come from countries that mistreat workers or harm the environment and try to use donated goods instead of buying new ones whenever the need presents itself.</li>
			<li class = "third"> Donate: There are great organizations who make it their mission to grow their economy sustainably, responsibly, and with care to others. Some include <a href ="https://cafa.iphiview.com/cafa/AccountInformation/tabid/495/dispatch/accountselection_id$201957_hash$a42f0e95a50907e8f4ecbd9b8895db8d0cc24bab/Default.aspx"> Blue Ventures Conservation Fund,</a> <a href = "https://theceme.org/contact-us/donate/"> The CEME Fund, </a> and the <a href = "https://cafa.iphiview.com/cafa/AccountInformation/tabid/495/dispatch/accountselection_id$204832_hash$867df2dae26bfde1f896f1d2783f8049df36c16c/Default.aspx">OUIK Friends Fund</a>.</li>
